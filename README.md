## App Brainstorming
Apps:
- Tiktok
  - Custom emojis
  - Sending videos to others
- Instagram
  - Creating highlights / stories
  - Hiding profile from specific people
- Reddit
  - Anonymous mode
  - Saving favorite communities

My app idea is a completely anonymous social media. There is no account creation at all, nor is there any form of identifying who says what. Obviously, there would have to be
strict content guidelines in place, but the goal of the platform is to talk without any biases caused by the profile of the person you talk to.
Features include adding topics of interest, saving favorite messages, and creating reply threads.
A different app idea is a quick online game (Wordle or Connections fast). I'm not sure what the game would be, but it would usually last around a minute. There would be leaderboards
and you'd be able to share your score. Like GamePigeon but against anyone.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I think the hardest part about building this app was downloading Xcode and navigating its interface. Xcode feels very cluttered and I think it can be somewhat hard to use.
